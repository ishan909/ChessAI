# ChessAI
A GUI Chess game between a player and an AI!


# TODO
- Plan:
  - [x] Set a color to the AI
  - [x] Try to set weights to the pieces (based on importance)
  - [x] Perform random moves based on weights
  - [ ] Use minimax algorithm and use small depths first and then larger and larger
  - [ ] Use Alpha-Beta Pruning to make sure that useless moves are disregarded (increase depth)
  - [ ] AI is completed, make it more efficient or add a twist to make it better
