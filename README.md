# ChessAI
A GUI Chess game that can be played between 2 players or an AI and a player!


#TODO
- Plan:
  - 1. Set a color to the AI
  - 2. Randomly generate moves (move generation)
  - 3. Try to set weights to the pieces (based on importance)
  - 4. Perform random moves based on weights
  - 5. Use minimax algorithm and use small depths first and then larger and larger
  - 6. Use Alpha-Beta Pruning to make sure that useless moves are disregarded (increase depth)
  - 7. AI is completed, make it more efficient or add a twist to make it better
