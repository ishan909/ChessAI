# ChessAI

## Description
The game allows a user to play 1v1 against a Chess AI in a GUI interface. 


### Further Improvements (TODO)
Some further improvements to the project include fixing some minor bugs as well as improving the recursive strength of 
the AI algorithm. This can be done using specialized optimization methods that will be looked into carefully and will take into consideration finer nuances in the game such as move ordering and finding a better mechanism to lessen the massive recursive restructure that is built.
